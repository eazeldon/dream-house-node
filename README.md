### User Story

As a site owner, I want to showcase and market my business, so that visitors get an idea of what they can expect from a visit to my "Dream House". As a visitor, I want to see pictures of the houses and locations as well as get information about what is offered, to help me decide if I want to buy. This project assumes the visitor is mainly using a laptop or smartphone.
